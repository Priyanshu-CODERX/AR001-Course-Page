AR001: Augmented Reality for Everyone
</h1>
By 2022 the XR market is expected to reach $209 billion, which is eight times what it was in 2020. This tremendous growth could mean the realities of our 2030 lives are beyond our imaginationâ€™s ability to grasp. In this course you are going to learn about Extended Reality from both Theoritical and Practical prospect, we will be learning to develop Augmented Reality mobile applications and Augmented Reality Filters for Instagram and Facebook from scratch, this course is designed for absolute beginners and professionals and because the course is designed for both professionals and beginners we covered every concept from scratch such as XR Fundamentals, Unity Engine, C#, Markerbased AR Development and AR Filter development.
